description: Solve for a challenge with Rust and AES.

## Intro

The BrunnerCTF is a 48h online CTF created by the [Brunnerne team](https://brunnerne.dk/).

For this challenge we get a file named **Grandmas_Secret_Baking_Family_Recipe.enc** wich contains encrypted datas and an ELF named **Bakeware**.
The goal of this challenge is to decrypt the encrypted datas.
The difficulty for me is that I've almost never coded in Rust, I can only read the binary code and improvise.

## The Write-up

With a `file` command we notice that the binary isn't stripped, which is cool.

To begin, I inspected the Rust *main* function with the r2 disassembler.

```txt
[0x00007bc0]> s sym.Bakeware::main::h837f6b7d44b9b487
[0x00008c60]> pdf
```

The first thing we notice is that the ELF try to open a file named **Grandmas_Secret_Baking_Family_Recipe.txt**.

```txt
... args
0x00008ca0      488d15c27c..   lea rdx, [0x00050969]       ; "Grandmas_Secret_Baking_Family_Recipe.txtFile not found. Nothing to steal
... more args
0x00008cbc      ff153e9b0500   call qword [sym.std::fs::OpenOptions::\_open::hce0f5e8979d4b5a1]
...
```

I guess that the file will be encrypted and that the output will be the `.enc` file. That's why I create a backup
of the encrypted file.

```txt
user_one@machine:bakeware $ cp Grandmas_Secret_Baking_Family_Recipe.enc Grandmas_Secret_Baking_Family_Recipe.enc.bak
```

If the file opening is a success the binary perfoms a SHA256 on the content of the `.txt` file.

```txt
            0x00008d12      a801           test al, 1
│      ┌──< 0x00008d14      0f85a60b0000   jne 0x98c0
│      ││   0x00008d1a      488dbc2490..   lea rdi, [var_190h]
│      ││   0x00008d22      488db42460..   lea rsi, [var_560h]
│      ││   0x00008d2a      ff1500a10500   call qword [sym.__alloc::vec::Vec_u8__as_sha256::Sha256Digest_::digest::h94a9f04017ae2932]
```

A bit further, we can see a call to the `bcmp` libc function. One of the arguments is a long string starting by what's seems to be a SHA256 hash.
The second argument passed to the func is `0x40` (64 in decimal notation). A SHA256 hash being 64 bytes long, it looks like an hash comparison.

```txt
0x00008d8a      488d35247c..   lea rsi, [0x000509b5]       ; "502ff05a7b51b76e740b19cc4957ad118897a25becbb87fcb662a14b2e56a5d9Sec..."
0x00008d91      ba40000000     mov edx, 0x40               ; elf_phdr
0x00008d96      4c89f7         mov rdi, r14
0x00008d99      ff15299f0500   call qword [reloc.bcmp]     ; [0x62cc8:8]=0
```

The solution to bypass this is obviously to change the value of the hash during the execution or read the code to see if
this verification really matters.

> I search a way to obtain a file content that validate the hash even though I knew that it's almost impossible to get a collision.
> I still don't know why I did that.

Once the hash verification done, there is several calls to a `get_key_part` function.

```txt
...
0x00008db6      e895fdffff     call sym Bakeware::get_key_part::hd4d7de7168456fd6
...
0x00008dcd      e87efdffff     call sym Bakeware::get_key_part::hd4d7de7168456fd6
...
0x00008de4      e867fdffff     call sym Bakeware::get_key_part::hd4d7de7168456fd6
...
0x00008dfb      e850fdffff     call sym Bakeware::get_key_part::hd4d7de7168456fd6
...
0x00008e12      e839fdffff     call sym Bakeware::get_key_part::hd4d7de7168456fd6
...
0x00008e29      e822fdffff     call sym Bakeware::get_key_part::hd4d7de7168456fd6
...
```

A bit further there is calls to AES related functions. We can guess that `get_key_part` is used to build
the key for decryption.

Because I'm not able to reverse the `get_key_part` function statically, I used GDB.
I search a function where the key could be passed as an argument and this seems to be a good candidate:

```txt
0x0000c4b0    1   1355 sym.__aes::ni::Aes256Enc_as_crypto_common::KeyInit_::new::haaa3a7e26e4efd28 
```

The first breakpoint is set a the `bcmp` call, the second at the `KeyInit` line.

```txt
(gdb) b* 0x100008d99
Breakpoint 1 at 0x100008d99
(gdb) b* 0x100009410
Breakpoint 2 at 0x10000c4b0

It looks like **OTHellOTotallyStealGoodRecipes!!** is our key ! Later in the code there is calls to functions used
to make the padding necessary to every AES implementations but I decided to decrypt the file without investigating this part.
I don't know which AES mode is used but It won't be hard to test every of them anyway. I first tried with the CBC mode because
it's one of the most popular.

```py
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = b'OTHellOTotallyStealGoodRecipes!!'
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
f = open("Grandmas_Secret_Baking_Family_Recipe.enc.bak","rb")
ciphertext = bytes(f.read())

plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

print(plaintext)
```

```
user_one@machine:bakeware $ python decrypt.py

```

We get the flag: **brunner{Gr4ndm4_sh0u1d_R34lL7_l34rn_b3tt3r_0ps3c}**.
